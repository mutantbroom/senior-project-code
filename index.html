      <p1>My name is Jonathan and this will be the future site of my senior project!</p1>
      <br>
      <p2>From February to May I will be improving this site with what I learn about HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Be sure to check back here from time to time to see how this website changes over the course of my project!</p2>
      <br>
      <p3>Thanks for visiting!</p3>
